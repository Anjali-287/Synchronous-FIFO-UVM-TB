# Synchronous-FIFO-UVM-TB
UVM Testbench for synchronus fifo

I have written a testbench for synchronous fifo in which I'm running my testbench starting from fifo being empty then I have written data into it until the fifo is full, then I have read from it until fifo is empty again, while reading I have compared whether the data which I'm reading is same as what I have written previously.
